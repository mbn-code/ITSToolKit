# ITSToolKit

This is the Indian Tech Support Tool Kit "ITSToolKit". Click [here](https://github.com/CollinEdward/ITSToolKit/releases/tag/ITSToolKit) to go to the v1.080 release, which is the first stable build tested on multiple operating systems and different hardware.

**Note:** This toolkit requires Python 3.10. You cannot use any other version because it utilizes the new `match` "case" feature introduced in Python 3.10.

If you want to use the toolkit by simply typing "ITSToolKit" in the terminal, follow these steps:

1. Add `ITSToolKit.py` and `ITSToolKit.sh` to the `/bin/` folder.
2. You can do this manually or use the `AptInstaller.py` or `PacmanInstallerReq.py` (depending on your distribution) file to automate the process. These files will also install all the required dependencies for the toolkit.

Thank you for using ITSToolKit. Enjoy the toolkit!
